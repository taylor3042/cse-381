## 2. Overview & Purpose
<!-- Describe the purpose of the algorithm and what it is used for. -->

## 3. Methodology
<!-- Describe the design of the algorithm.  This should be detailed enough to both understand how the algorithm works and be sufficient to code in any language.  Detailed descriptions will be more than 100 words. 

The inclusion of a picture describing the how the algorithm works will earn bonus points.
