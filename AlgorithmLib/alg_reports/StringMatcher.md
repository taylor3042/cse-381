String Matcher

## 2. Overview & Purpose
<!-- Describe the purpose of the algorithm and what it is used for. -->

## 3. Methodology
<!-- Describe the design of the algorithm.  This should be detailed enough to both understand how the algorithm works and be sufficient to code in any language.  Detailed descriptions will be more than 100 words. 

The inclusion of a picture describing the how the algorithm works will earn bonus points.

## 4. Analysis Results

The performance of matching assuming the finite state machine table is already built (where $m$ is the length of the pattern and $n$ is the length of the text being checked)

* Worst Case: $O()$
* Best Case: $\Omega()$

## 5. AI Report

### 5.1 Research

Research this algorithm on ChatGPT by asking at least 5 questions (e.g. follow-up questions from the previous response, things from the reading or class that was confusing).  Identify at least 2 things that you learned about the algorithm from your research:

1.
2.

### 5.2 Code Comparison

Ask ChatGPT to write code for this algorithm in C#.  Compare the code that you wrote with the code that ChatGPT responded with.  Identify any differences from your code, explain why they are different, and determine if the differences should be adopted.
